            Welcome to the Giovanni Experiment!

            This is a simple Java application created to explore Gradle, Build Scans,
            and JVM-based development. I’m a technology enthusiast who enjoys stepping
            out of my comfort zone to learn and experiment with new tools and techniques.

            Through this project, I’m exploring the fundamentals of Java development
            and experimenting with Gradle’s powerful build automation capabilities.

            Stay curious, keep experimenting, and have fun coding!
